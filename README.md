# GOLF

To do:
* newsletter
    * implement API Push request for newsletter emails
    * front-end
    * create the actual newsletter
* about page
    * add text to about page
    * maybe donate button to charity?
* database
    * finally decide on a structure and implement it
    * add an abstraction layer for db in form .py file with query and write functions to separate concerns
* backend
    * log each timestamp in file for keeping track of holes in db (say if server goes down, based on this file we'll know what we need to add to db)
